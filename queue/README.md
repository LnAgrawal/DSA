# Queue Module
A Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The LinkedList class implements the Queue interface, allowing queue operations.

Common Operations:

* add(element): Inserts the specified element into the queue.
* poll(): Retrieves and removes the head of the queue.
* peek(): Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue.
* isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
