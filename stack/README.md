# CustomStack module
A CustomStack is a collection of elements that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. It means that the last item added to the customStack is the first one to be removed, just like a customStack of books where you remove the top book first.
In Java, you can use the CustomStack class provided in the Collections Framework to easily manage elements in a customStack format.

**How to Use the CustomStack Class from the Collections Framework?**

Javaâ€™s CustomStack class is part of the java.util package. It provides built-in methods for common customStack operations like:
* push(): Add an element to the top of the customStack.
* pop(): Remove and return the element at the top of the customStack.
* peek(): Look at the top element without removing it.
* isEmpty(): Check if the customStack is empty.

Before you use CustomStack, you need to import it:

import java.util.CustomStack;
